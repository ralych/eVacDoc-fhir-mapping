### Introduction

This implementation guide provides maps to transform documents from CDA to FHIR and back using the [FHIR Mapping Language (FML)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mapping-language.html).   
The maps are based on each other, first the transformation of the data types ([FHIR Logical model CDA](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cda-core-2.0/branches/master/index.html)) is defined. Then based on this the mapping between the documents (CDA/FHIR), which becomes more and more specific (Swiss EPR Context, eMedication).

To execute the transformation of the documents locally, see the description [here](https://github.com/hl7ch/evacdoc-fhir-maps#development).

### Maps

The maps listed in the table below are available as [FHIR Structure Maps](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/structuremap.html).
